# Deployment

Before deploying your GraphQL app to production you should disable `GraphiQL`
and `Introspection`.

## Why are they a problem?

1. They can reveal sensitive information (e.g. internal business logic)

2. They make it easier for malicious parties to reverse engineer your GraphQL
   API

[See more on this topic](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/graphql/security/why-you-should-disable-graphql-introspection-in-production/)

## How to disable them

### GraphiQL

GraphiQL is useful during testing and development but should be disabled in
production by default.

It can be turned off by setting the `graphql_ide` option to `None`

See the Strawberry Options documentation for the integration you are using for
more information on how to disable it:

- [AIOHTTP](/docs/integrations/aiohttp#options)
- [ASGI](/docs/integrations/asgi#options)
- [Django](/docs/integrations/django#options)
- [FastAPI](/docs/integrations/fastapi#options)
- [Flask](/docs/integrations/flask#options)
- [Quart](/docs/integrations/quart#options)
- [Sanic](/docs/integrations/sanic#options)
- [Chalice](/docs/integrations/chalice#options)
- [Starlette](/docs/integrations/starlette#options)

### Introspection

Introspection should primarily be used as a discovery and diagnostic tool for
testing and development, and should be disabled in production by default.

You can disable introspection by
[adding a validation rule extension](/docs/extensions/add-validation-rules#more-examples).

## Security extensions

Strawberry provides some security extensions to limit various aspects of the
GraphQL document. These are recommended in production.

- [query depth](/docs/extensions/query-depth-limiter)
- [max number of aliases](/docs/extensions/max-aliases-limiter)
- [max number of tokens](/docs/extensions/max-tokens-limiter)

The docs for [ASGI](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and
[Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) do not provide an official deployment
guide, but you may find the documentation for other frameworks that use ASGI
servers useful (e.g. [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/))
